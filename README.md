# **Tools Used**
The frontend was created with react using the D3JS libray and the backend was created with nodejs and express. The data displayed was scraped using python by opening a connection to the Oregon Health Authority website and scraping the website using BeautifulSoup. The data is loaded into a PostgreSQL database. This was deployed using Heroku.
